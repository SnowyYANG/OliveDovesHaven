# Haven for an Olive Tree and Doves

In an unknown place on the Earth, there is growing an olive tree.  
Water to grow the tree, build nests on the treeâ€‹ to attract doves, feed doves.  
Doves will fly out with the olive leaves, and fortunately come back with colorful flags!  

This idle game is under planning.  
Currently it only has a pure text concept prototype (haven-txt-demo.html).  
It may be visualized, may be pixel-art, or hand-drawn, and with music, may be 8-bit, or lyre.
