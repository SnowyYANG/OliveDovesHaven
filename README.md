# Haven for an Olive Tree and Doves

In an unknown place on the Earth, there is growing an olive tree.  
Water to growing the tree, build nests on the treeâ€‹ to attract doves, feed doves.  
Doves will fly out with the olive leaves, and fortunately come back with colorful flags!  

This idle game is under planning and developing.  
Currently it only has a pure text concept demo (haven-txt-demo.html).  
It would be visualized, may be pixel-art, or hand-drawn, and with music, may be 8-bit, or lyre.
